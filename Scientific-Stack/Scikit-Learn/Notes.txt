Linear Regression: fit intercept=True, gives a much better fit (R-score)

											in this case


Kmeans: unsupervised -> only need a features matrix

2-features in matrix, bc easier to visualize clusters in two dimensions

PCA is also unsupervised. 

Pipelines Workflow, for PCA:

- train test split
- standardization
- fit step, for pca, the logistic reg

sometimes splitting the data randomly is not the best approach, for example
